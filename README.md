# Count Digits

A basic interactive web form to count digit occurrences in a range of numbers,
try it live at: [sionleroux.com/count-digits.html][live-site]

Basic, minimalist design using unmodified [sscaffold][sscaffold].

Interactivity using [Alpine.js][alpinejs].

Bespoke `countDigitOccurances` function to do the actual work because I couldn't
find any simple lib or other solution for it that seemed quick enough to
implement. For the small range of numbers I'm interested in performance doesn't
really matter, so the simplest approach works fine.
